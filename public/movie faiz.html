<h1>The Best Movies According to Faiz</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Rockstar</h3>
<p>This is my all time favourite movie. Because the essence of true love is purely depicted in this movie. A master class by Imtiaz Ali and outsatnding acting done by Ranbir Kapoor. I would recommend you all to definetly watch it.</p>
<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>Really loved the movie since it taught me a life lesson as to how to learn something rather than mugging up you should understand the content.</p>
<h3>Inside Man</h3>
<p>All I would say about this movie is the suspense is immense in this movie.</p>
